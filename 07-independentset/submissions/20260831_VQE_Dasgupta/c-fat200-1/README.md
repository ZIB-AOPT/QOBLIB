| Remarks | NOTE ON '# Successful Runs': all 10 sampling trials' raw bitstrings are pooled and deduplicated together before the final best independent set is extracted, so no single trial alone reaches the reported best size. It is a joint result of all trials. Individual per-trial raw-sample size is not predictive of final MIS quality, since smaller seeds can extend further under maximality-driving (local search); additionally, per our reference paper, the bitstring-correction heuristic uses an EMA that improves across successive trials, so later trials are more likely to yield the MIS than earlier ones. The trials are not i.i.d. and cannot be scored independently. '# Successful Runs' = 10 reflects that all trials contributed feasible samples to this pooled, cumulative outcome, not that each trial individually matched the best size. Total Runtime = 1537.14s classical VQE parameter optimization (AerSimulator MPS) + 284.06s post-optimization sampling/bitstring correction. c-fat200-1 is a sparse graph (200 nodes, 1534 edges) with a very large maximum-independent-set count; best set of size 18 matches QOBLIB's best-known (optimal) value. Notably, 3875 distinct maximum-size (18) independent sets were found among the unique independent sets extracted from post-optimization sampling. To our knowledge no prior submission has reported the multiplicity of optimal solutions recovered for this instance. |

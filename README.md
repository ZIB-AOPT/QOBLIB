## Description 

With the aim of enabling fair, comparable, and meaningful benchmarks for quantum optimization methods, we here present ten optimization problem classes that are difficult for existing classical algorithms and can (mostly) be linked to practically-relevant applications.
While the individual properties of the problem classes vary in terms of objective and variable type, coefficient ranges, and density, they all become challenging for established classical methods already at system sizes in the range of about 100 to 10 000 decision variables.
This repository holds problem instances of varying complexity, exemplary model descriptions, solution track records, and references or explicit functionality for checking solution feasibility.

## Overview

QOBLIB enables **fair, comparable, and meaningful benchmarks** for quantum optimization methods by providing:

- **10 optimization problem classes** difficult for classical algorithms yet tied to practical applications
- **Problem instances** of varying complexity (100 to 10,000 decision variables)
- **Model descriptions** in standard formats
- **Solution track records** with optimal/best-known solutions
- **Verification tools** to check solution feasibility

The problem classes vary in objective type, variable type, coefficient ranges, and density, all becoming challenging for established classical methods at moderate system sizes.

## Problem Complexity Landscape

The plots below illustrate the computational difficulty of our problem instances across different formulations. Both MIP and QUBO formulations show how the instances become increasingly challenging with growing problem size and density, making them ideal benchmarks for emerging quantum optimization methods.

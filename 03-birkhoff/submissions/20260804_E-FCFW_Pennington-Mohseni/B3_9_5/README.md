| Remarks | Approximate cost is $f(X) = (1/n^2)  \\| X - D^* \\|^2_F$ where $D^*$ is the $n$ by $n$ target doubly stochastic matrix and $X$ its (approximate) decomposition. The algorithm is executed over $k$ sequential steps, with the number of decision variables increasing at each step. The reported number of decision variables corresponds to the final step, which has the largest number of decision variables. The CPU time is computed using the total usage time in the IBM Quantum platform, minus the QPU time.  |

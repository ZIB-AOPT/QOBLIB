| Best Objective Value | 406 |
| Optimality Bound | 151 |
| Modeling Approach | Exact decomposition, weights with the precision of the data. Solution chain: weights from the frequency rule, placed by fixing by unique subset sums (sparse); Birkhoff algorithm with the zeroing rule, beam search over zeroing steps, SAT re-optimization of the tail, large neighborhood search (dense). Bound chain in the same run: degree, two-line bound, SAT certificates |

| Remarks | Exact decomposition (no tolerance), with weights of the precision of the data (integers at the given scale). The Optimality Bound holds for real weights (degree or two-line bound); its certificate is B100_10000_2_certificate.json. 5 independent runs with the seeds 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. A run: 60 s per instance; without a proof of optimality, a second round of 600 s that starts from scratch; the result of the run is the shorter decomposition of the two rounds. Best Objective Value: the shortest decomposition over the runs. Optimality Bound: the largest lower bound over the runs that holds for real weights. Total Runtime: the time of the whole run (both rounds). Time to Solution: the time from the start of the run until it first found a decomposition of its final length (the second round counts from the end of the first). Both are means over the 5 runs. CPU Runtime: the measured CPU time of all threads in both rounds, mean over the runs with the seeds 1 to 4 (the CPU time of the run with seed 0 was not measured). The objective time series has one element per run: the incumbent of the run over both rounds, the second round shifted by the runtime of the first. Length over the runs (seeds 0 to 4): 406, 406, 407, 407, 407; mean 406.6, median 407, std 0.55. Total runtime [s]: 660.2601, 660.2916, 660.1337, 660.2041, 660.1714; median 660.204, std 0.064. Time to solution [s]: 16.1604, 13.3330, 30.5322, 365.6911, 39.1413; median 30.532, std 152.819. The planted decomposition in the instance file is never read. |

| Reference | https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.25837 (article), https://github.com/tg90000/rcs-birkhoff (code) |
| Best Objective Value | 199 |
| Optimality Bound | 75 |
| Modeling Approach | Exact decomposition, weights with the precision of the data. Solution chain: weights from the frequency rule, placed by fixing by unique subset sums (sparse); Birkhoff algorithm with the zeroing rule, beam search over zeroing steps, SAT re-optimization of the tail, large neighborhood search (dense). Bound chain in the same run: degree, two-line bound, SAT certificates |

| Remarks | Exact decomposition (no tolerance), with weights of the precision of the data (integers at the given scale). Proofs of optimality by the degree or two-line bound hold for real weights too; proofs by SAT certificates (small dense instances) hold for weights of this precision. 5 independent runs with the seeds 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. A run: 60 s per instance; without a proof of optimality, a second round of 600 s; the result of the run is the shorter decomposition of the two rounds, with the runtime and time to solution of its round. Best Objective Value: the shortest decomposition over the runs. Optimality Bound: the largest lower bound over the runs. Total Runtime and Time to Solution: means over the 5 runs; the time to solution of a run is the time at which it found its own final decomposition. CPU Runtime: the measured CPU time of all threads, mean over the runs with the seeds 1 to 4 (the CPU time of the run with seed 0 was not measured). The objective time series has one entry per run. Length over the runs (seeds 0 to 4): 200, 199, 200, 200, 201; mean 200.0, median 200, std 0.71. Total runtime [s]: 600.0046, 600.0202, 600.0225, 600.0153, 60.0147; median 600.015, std 241.496. Time to solution [s]: 87.9477, 138.2022, 320.9030, 400.5132, 11.9484; median 138.202, std 162.967. The planted decomposition in the instance file is never read. |

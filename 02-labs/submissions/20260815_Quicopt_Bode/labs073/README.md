| Hardware Specifications | AMD EPYC-Rome, 255 vCPUs, 503 GB RAM; Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS, Linux 6.8.0, x86-64 |
| ====== |  |
| Total Runtime | 423.566667 |
| Time to Solution | 337.591111 |
| CPU Runtime | 3790.884444 |
| GPU Runtime | 0 |
| QPU Runtime | 0 |
| Other HW Runtime | 0 |
| ====== |  |
| Remarks | Runtimes are averaged over the runs; runs share a common pre-processing stage whose cost is divided among them, and were executed concurrently, so the wall-clock includes contention. # Successful Runs counts the runs that reached the reported objective (epsilon = 0). |

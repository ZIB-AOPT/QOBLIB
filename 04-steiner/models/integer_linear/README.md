# Integer Linear Programming Formulation

This directory contains the integer linear programming formulation for the Steiner Tree Packing problem. This formulation corresponds to the model described in Section 2.2 of the paper "Steiner tree packing revisited", provided in the [info](./../../info/) directory.

The formulation yields an integer linear optimization problem where all decision variables are binary.

We do not provide all the generated LP-files here as they are too large. Use the script `gen_archive.sh` to generate all the LP-files.
